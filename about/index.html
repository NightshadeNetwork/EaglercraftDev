    <h1>About EaglercraftDev</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: July 16, 2024</p>
    <br>
    <p>Welcome to EaglercraftDev! Glad you dropped by. Our mission is to provide a stable, secure, and ad-free platform hosting both official and third-party Eaglercraft clients.</p>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>EaglercraftDev aims to be the go-to resource for access to Eaglercraft, as we host a wide variety of clients, with a client listing.</p>

    <h2>What We Offer</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ease of Access:</strong> Access to both official and third-party Eaglercraft clients in one place.</li>
        <li><strong>Stable Archiving:</strong> We maintain backups, offline downloads, and more to ensure that no client goes forgotten, etc, etc, etc. (Should I throw in a few more?)</li>
        <li><strong>Ad-Free Experience:</strong> Enjoy uninterrupted browsing and gameplay without any advertisements. This will not change, we have no plans to add ads as they can be malicious, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Safety First:</strong> All clients are vetted for security to protect our users.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why EaglercraftDev?</h2>
    <div class="highlight">
        <p>We here at EaglercraftDev pride ourselves on our features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Free client hosting - We will host your client on request.</li>
            <li>Long-term preservation of Eaglercraft versions (unless the creators of closed-source clients request that we remove them.)</li>
            <li>User-friendly, ad-free interface</li>
            <li>Rigorous safety checks on all hosted clients (Probably Unneeded, but I digress)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Our Process</h2>
    <p>We follow the following "rules" to ensure that our service remains online, safe, and fun for you.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Collection:</strong> We gather both official and notable third-party Eaglercraft clients. <a href="mailto:support@eaglercraft.dev">Send us an email to request a client.</a></li>
        <li><strong>Vetting:</strong> Our "team" thoroughly examines each client for potential security risks. We ensure that it doesn't log commands, typed messages, or even mine crypto in your browser.</li>
        <li><strong>Archiving:</strong> This site is purely for archival purposes, approved clients are securely stored in our stable archive.</li>
        <li><strong>Presentation:</strong> Clients are made available through our user-friendly interface.</li>

        <div class="error-item">

                <li>Keep your operating system and antivirus software up to date. (Do I even need to add this? If you're EoL, get a patcher (if it's trusted) please.)</li>
                <li>Be cautious when using third-party clients and report any suspicious behavior to maintainers on our Discord.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
