        <h1>Eaglercraft.dev: About Us?</h1>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>Welcome to Eaglercraft.dev. We're here because apparently, running a decent Minecraft community is rocket science for some people.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>The Eaglercraft community is a masterclass in how to run things into the ground. It's almost impressive how they've managed to take a game about building and turn it into a showcase of destruction. Bravo.</p>
        
        <h2>The Idiocy (In Detail!)</h2>
        <div class="error-section">
            <div class="error-item">
                <h3>Arbitrary Banning</h3>
                <p>Imagine giving a toddler a loaded gun. Now imagine that gun bans people from their "Community Discord". That's the current state of moderation. It's like they're running a competition for "Fastest Way to Kill a Community" and going for gold, even though they rigged it already.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="error-item">
                <h3>Suppression of New Ideas</h3>
                <p>You'd think new ideas were radioactive given how quickly they're shut down. God forbid someone suggests an improvement - that might require the admins to actually do something other than flex their ban muscles. Turns out it's just love handles, unless jitter-clicking Ctrl-V to paste <code>?ban therealserver</code>. If they haven't, maybe this is the time to.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="error-item">
                <h3>Hostility Towards Newcomers</h3>
                <p>Their welcome wagon is more like a welcome guillotine. Nothing says "thriving community" like treating newcomers as if they're carrying the plague. It's a bold strategy - let's see how driving away all new blood works out for them. Even if people are moronic, they're still people.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="error-item">
                <h3>Lack of Transparency</h3>
                <p>Every "third-party launcher" or client all have their own private source code, which is just AI-Generated Grade-A (Tier S) Bullshit. Want a share of the pie? Ask GPT-4o to make you a Minecraft Launcher using HTML5, CSS3, and then watch as you magically see the same website you were staring at in disgust an hour ago.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Our "Revolutionary" Approach (Also Known as Basic Competence)</h2>
        <p>We've embarked on the apparently Herculean task of not being complete idiots. I know, contain your shock.</p>
        
        <p>Here's our groundbreaking strategy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> We will share our code if prompted! This is to help those who want to make their own client.</li>
            <li><strong>Support for Innovation:</strong> New ideas don't send us into a panic. We're brave like that.</li>
            <li><strong>Actual Help:</strong> We answer questions in English, not in riddles or grunts. The latter is common among those who partake in the other mainstream community.</li>
            <li><strong>Fair Moderation:</strong> We don't ban people for existing. The bar is low, but we're clearing it.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>What We're Offering (Besides a Headache-Free Experience)</h2>
        <p>Brace yourselves for these mind-blowing offerings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Client Hosting:</strong> We'll host your Eaglercraft client, granted that either we or the users trust it.</li>
            <li><strong>Server Integration:</strong> Get your server on our lists. We promise not to lose it in the couch cushions.</li>
            <li><strong>Development Support:</strong> Our source code isn't public, but we'll help you. Just give us a mention. We're not asking for your firstborn, just a little credit.</li>
            <li><strong>A Community That's Not a Dumpster Fire:</strong> We've set the bar so low it's a tripping hazard in Hell, yet here we are, limbo dancing with the devil.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>The Long-Term Plan (Yes, We Actually Have One)</h2>
        <p>We're going to keep updating, improving, and generally not screwing things up. It's a novel approach in these parts, I know. We might even listen to feedback - don't faint from the shock.</p>
        
        <h2>What to Expect</h2>
        <p>With any luck, and a generous application of common sense, we might just create a community that doesn't make you want to gouge your eyes out. Expect fewer random bans, less idea suppression, and a marked decrease in the urge to scream into the void.</p>
        
        <p>Fair warning: exposure to the general Eaglercraft community may still cause spontaneous facepalming and loss of faith in humanity. We're good, but we're not miracle workers.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>Just want to have some fun?  Come for the game, stay for the rare pleasure of not wanting to hurl your computer out the window.</p>
