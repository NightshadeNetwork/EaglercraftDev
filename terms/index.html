        <h1>Eaglercraft.dev: Terms of Service</h1>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>Welcome to our Terms of Service, where we outline how little we're involved in your Eaglercraft adventures. Think of us as tech support during a major outage: technically present, but not really helpful.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By using this site, you agree to these terms. If you don't agree, well, there's always Minesweeper. Just like those "agree" buttons in software installations, you don't really have a choice.</p>
        
        <div class="error-section">
            <div class="error-item">
                <h3>2. Use of Service</h3>
                <p>You agree to use this service for its intended purpose: playing browser-based Minecraft clones. Any other use, like trying to host your blockchain project, is not our problem. It's like using a gaming console for serious work—possible, but not advisable.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="error-item">
                <h3>3. User Conduct</h3>
                <p>Do whatever you want, we're not your parents. Just remember, if you break the law, that's on you. We’re about as involved in moderating this platform as a router is in managing your streaming habits.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>All content on this site is owned by... well, not us. We're just hosting it. If you've got beef with the content, take it up with the original creators. We're just the delivery guys, like an app store but without the dubious curation process.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Limitations of Liability</h2>
        <p>We're not responsible for anything that happens on this platform. If you get into a heated argument about the best way to mine resources, that's your business. If your device overheats and crashes, take it up with your device's manufacturer.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>If you get us in trouble, you agree to defend us. Not just legally, but physically if necessary. We hope you've been working on your PvP skills. Think of it like protecting your server from DDoS attacks: constant vigilance required.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These terms are governed by the laws of whatever jurisdiction we end up in if things go south. Any disputes will be settled by a code review, judged by three impartial developers. It's a more reliable system than trying to get a straight answer from tech support.</p>
        
        <h2>8. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these terms whenever we remember this page exists. It's your responsibility to check back and see what new disclaimers we've thought up, just like keeping track of your software update notifications.</p>
        
        <h2>9. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We host third-party clients that users send to us after verifying they are not malicious. If you decide to use these clients, remember that they are as much under our control as a rogue AI in a sci-fi movie. That is, not at all. You're on your own with those, like navigating the dark web without a guide.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>By using Eaglercraft.dev, you agree that you're on your own. We're not watching, we're not moderating, we're not liable. If you're looking for a platform that cares about your user experience, maybe try a nostalgia trip on AOL. Oh wait, that doesn't exist anymore... Try MSN! Microsoft still offers that garbage for some reason, quit stealing our elders' Social Security via a dead service they haven't stopped paying for since &apos;95. </p>
