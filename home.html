    <h1>Eaglercraft Launcher</h1>
    <p>This website is in Development. We aren't currently finished, but we hope that our service will eventually become more usable and more informative.</p>
    
    <h2>What is Eaglercraft?</h2>
    <p>Eaglercraft is a fully-fledged version of Minecraft in your browser. It has all items in Minecraft versions Alpha 1.2-Release 1.8.8, and play community-made servers, too! You can play Eaglercraft on a phone as well, and our site has its own mobile UI. Eaglercraft supports all modern web browsers, so you can play Minecraft anytime, anywhere. Play Eaglercraft now on eaglercraft.dev by clicking the play button in your bottom right.</p>
