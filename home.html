    <h1 itemprop="name">Eaglercraft Launcher</h1>
    <p itemprop="description">This website is in Development. We aren't currently finished, but we hope that our service will eventually become more usable and more informative.</p>
    <p>We're not some skidded "launcher for <strong>Eaglercraft</strong>," instead this is a project built from the ground-up to provide a cleaner, safer experience when attempting to play/download <strong>Eaglercraft</strong>.</p>
    <h2>What is Eaglercraft?</h2>
    <p itemprop="description"><strong>Eaglercraft</strong> is a fully-fledged version of Minecraft in your browser. It has all items in Minecraft versions Alpha 1.2-Release 1.8.8, and plays community-made servers, too! You can play <strong>Eaglercraft</strong> on a phone as well, and our site has its own mobile UI. <strong>Eaglercraft</strong> supports all modern web browsers, so you can play Minecraft anytime, anywhere. Play <strong>Eaglercraft</strong> now on eaglercraft.dev by clicking the play button in your bottom right.</p>
