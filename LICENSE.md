### 2. Project Nature and Scope

EaglercraftDev is a launcher for modified clients which can load Eaglercraft if the user wishes. This project is not the Eaglercraft source code itself, nor does it claim ownership or rights over Eaglercraft. EaglercraftDev is a separate and distinct project that provides functionality to load and interact with Eaglercraft and other compatible clients.

### 3. Grant of License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor grants You a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited right to use, modify, and distribute the Source Code solely for contributing to the EaglercraftDev project.

### 4. Modification and Distribution

You may only modify and distribute the Source Code if you've received explicit written permission from the Licensor or the Maintainer (if authorized by the Licensor). This permission must come directly from one of the entities or individuals collectively referred to as the Licensor: ServerNootNoot, ServerDotSo, Server.So, ServerSo, therealserver, or from the Maintainer (Solenten/luckiersnail/Atticuss320) if they've been granted this authority by the Licensor.

To request permission, reach out to `therealserver` or the Maintainer on Discord through the official EaglercraftDev Discord server ([https://discord.eaglercraft.dev/](https://discord.eaglercraft.dev/)).

In the event that the project is officially discontinued, archived, or if the Licensor, ServerSo, is deceased, this License will automatically grant permission to modify and distribute the Source Code without the need for further permissions from the Licensor. This clause is intended to ensure the continuity and availability of the project beyond the Licensor's active involvement or lifetime.

### 5. Contributor Process and Restrictions

Individuals can become Contributors by applying through the official EaglercraftDev Discord ([https://discord.eaglercraft.dev/](https://discord.eaglercraft.dev/)). The Licensor or the Maintainer (if authorized by the Licensor) reserves the right to approve or deny contributor applications at their discretion.

Contributors are strictly prohibited from sharing copies of the Source Code, or the source to any file contained within the Repository, without explicit written permission from the Licensor or the authorized Maintainer. This restriction applies regardless of whether the sharing is done publicly or privately.

### 6. Prohibition of Reupload

Reuploading any part of the Repository, including but not limited to the Source Code, to any platform, whether publicly or privately, is strictly prohibited without explicit written permission from the Licensor or the authorized Maintainer. Unauthorized reuploads will be considered a violation of this License and subject to legal action.

### 7. Compliance with Laws

You must comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the use, modification, and distribution of the Source Code. This includes but is not limited to copyright laws, export regulations, and any relevant local, national, or international laws.

### 8. Disclaimer of Warranty

THE SOURCE CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

### 9. Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE SOURCE CODE, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

### 10. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Licensor from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees) arising out of or in connection with Your use, modification, or distribution of the Source Code.

### 11. Termination

The Licensor may terminate this License at any time if You fail to comply with any of the terms and conditions of this License. Upon termination, You must cease all use, modification, and distribution of the Source Code and destroy all copies of the Source Code in Your possession or control.

### 12. Successors and Assigns

This License shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors, and permitted assigns.

### 13. Governing Law

### 15. Severability

If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable, and the remaining provisions of this License shall remain in full force and effect.

### 16. No Waiver

The failure of the Licensor to enforce any right or provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.

### 17. Amendments

Your continued use of the Source Code after any such amendments constitutes Your acceptance of the new terms.

### 24. User Responsibility

Users of EaglercraftDev are responsible for ensuring that their use of the software, including any clients they choose to load, complies with all applicable laws and regulations. The Licensor and Contributors aren't responsible for any illegal or unauthorized use of the software.
