        <h1>Eaglercraft.dev: Privacy Policy</h1>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>Welcome to our Privacy Policy, where we explain how little we care about your data. Not because we don't care about you, but because data management is a headache we'd rather avoid, much like trying to understand cryptocurrency regulations.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>1. Data Collection (or Lack Thereof)</h2>
        <p>We collect about as much data as a browser-based game collects attention spans—basically, none. We’re not in the data business; we're in the "let's have fun without being spied on" business.</p>
        
        <div class="error-section">
            <div class="error-item">
                <h3>2. Personal Information</h3>
                <p>We don't ask for your personal information. We don't want it. We wouldn't know what to do with it if we had it. Your secrets are safe because we don't know them, and we aim to keep it that way.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="error-item">
                <h3>3. User Interactions</h3>
                <p>Whatever happens on the platform, stays on the platform. We don't moderate, we don't manage, we don't even watch. It's like having a Terms of Service document that no one reads—completely ignored.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <h2>4. Access Logs</h2>
        <p>We keep access logs because we want to be protected, and well logging is just a good idea in general. We'll only look at them if there's an attack on the website or a legal issue. So unless you’re planning on becoming the next big cyber threat, we won't be peeking. It's not like we're running a surveillance state here. Or are we?</p>
        
        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We use third-party services of the Eaglercraft project, which runs through plugins to access servers. These may track user data, but it's beyond our control and we don’t have access to said data. If you're worried about this, consider contacting Eaglercraft's developers. Good luck with that!</p>
        
        <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We protect your (non-existent) data with the ferocity of a thousand suns! We have a decent firewall and our security is considered quite decent. Remember, we can't lose what we don't have!</p>
        
        <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this policy if we suddenly develop an interest in bureaucracy. But let’s be real, that's about as likely as a major tech company going a year without a data breach. Looking at the company that currently may be reading this!</p>
        
        <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have questions about this policy, you can contact us. But remember, we know as much about your data as a smartphone knows about conserving battery life.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>By using Eaglercraft.dev, you acknowledge that we’re not watching, not collecting, and definitely not interested in your data. If you’re looking for someone to care about your online activities, try a social media platform—they're great at pretending to care.</p>
