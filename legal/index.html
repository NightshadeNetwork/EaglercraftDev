        <h1>Eaglercraft.dev: Legal Disclaimer</h1>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>Welcome to our legal disclaimer. Please read this carefully. It's important, even if it's not as exciting as playing the game.</p>
            <p>The majority of content on this site is serious, but mixed in a pot with my terrible sense of humor, which comes from satire and making fun of stuff I may or may not support.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>1. Purpose of this Website</h2>
        <p>Eaglercraft.dev is an archival website dedicated to preserving and providing access to various versions of Eaglercraft clients that are already publicly available online. Our purpose is purely archival and educational.</p>
        
        <div class="error-section">
            <div class="error-item">
                <h3>2. Copyright and Intellectual Property</h3>
                <p>All Eaglercraft clients hosted on this website are publicly available elsewhere online, or given to us legally. We do not claim ownership of any of the hosted content. All copyrights and intellectual property rights belong to their respective owners.</p>
                <p>Speaking of ownership, hello there, Microsoft! We see you eyeing our little corner of the internet. Just remember, you can't copyright fun â€“ though we're sure you've tried. Your lawyers must be getting bored chasing small fry like us when there are perfectly good antitrust laws for you to dance around. Wanna know something cool? GitHub literally hosts Eaglercraft clients... Pretty sure you know what we're getting at.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="error-item">
                <h3>3. DMCA and Copyright Infringement</h3>
                <p>Eaglercraft.dev does not host any original copyrighted content. We only provide links to and copies of content that is already freely available online. Any DMCA takedown requests or copyright infringement claims should be directed to the original sources of the content or the Eaglercraft project itself, not to Eaglercraft.dev.</p>
                <p>If you're from Microsoft and your finger is hovering over the "Sue" button, maybe redirect that energy to making Minecraft: Bedrock Edition actually work properly? Just a thought. Oh, right, you bought Mojang for profit, not quality.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <h2>4. No Affiliation</h2>
        <p>Eaglercraft.dev is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or in any way officially connected with the Eaglercraft project, Mojang, Microsoft, or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates. If we were, we'd probably have better servers and more corporate buzzwords in our vocabulary. Besides the Eaglercraft project(s) and their community, they're more moronic than the average box of rocks.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Use at Your Own Risk</h2>
        <p>The use of any clients or code downloaded from this website is at your own risk. We are not responsible for any damage, data loss, or legal issues that may arise from the use of these resources. This includes, but is not limited to, your computer becoming sentient and deciding to mine Bitcoin instead of Minecraft blocks. We don't currently offer downloads, and stealing our code is more immoral than using our website.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, Eaglercraft.dev and its operators shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses resulting from:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your access to or use of or inability to access or use the resources;</li>
            <li>Any conduct or content of any third party on the resources, including without limitation, any defamatory, offensive or illegal conduct of other users or third parties;</li>
            <li>Any content obtained from the resources; or</li>
            <li>Unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In other words, if something goes wrong, don't come crying to us. We're just the messengers, and you know what they say about shooting the messenger (it's generally frowned upon).</p>
        
        <h2>7. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Eaglercraft.dev and its operators from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to your violation of these terms or your use of the website.</p>
        
        <h2>8. Modifications and Removals</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify or remove any content on this website at any time, for any reason, without notice. This includes scenarios where we receive legal threats, decide to redecorate, or simply wake up feeling a bit chaotic.</p>
        
        <h2>9. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>This disclaimer and your use of Eaglercraft.dev shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the website operators reside, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Unless, of course, you're from Microsoft's legal team, in which case we'll be happy to meet you in the food court of your nearest mall.</p>
        
        <h2>10. Changes to this Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>We may update this disclaimer from time to time. We will notify users of any changes by posting the new disclaimer on this page. You are advised to review this disclaimer periodically for any changes, or just for fun if you're really, really bored.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>By using Eaglercraft.dev, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this disclaimer. If you do not agree with any part of this disclaimer, please do not use our website or any resources provided herein. There are plenty of other ways to enjoy Minecraft, like, you know, actually buying it. It runs pretty smoothly on my Chromebook, better than Eaglercraft does.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>A Final Note to Microsoft</h2>
        <p>Dear Microsoft, we know you're reading this. We're flattered, really. While you're here, instead of trying to shut down fan projects, why not focus on some of your other properties? We hear Windows could use some work. Or maybe you could bring back Clippy? Now that would be a lawsuit we'd be interested in.</p>
        <p>Also, don't you think Eaglercraft is cool? Couldn't you just support it or buy it, make it official and require a Microsoft Account?</p>
