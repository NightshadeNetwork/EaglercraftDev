    <p>As with many innovative projects in the gaming world, Eaglercraft exists in a complex legal landscape. It's important for players to understand the legal considerations surrounding the game:</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h3>Copyright and Intellectual Property</h3>
        <p>Eaglercraft's relationship with copyright law is a topic of ongoing discussion:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The game uses elements of Minecraft's code and assets without official authorization from Mojang Studios or Microsoft.</li>
            <li>This unauthorized use has led to DMCA takedown notices being issued against some Eaglercraft repositories and websites.</li>
            <li>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) provides protection against unauthorized reproduction of copyrighted works, which applies to video games like Minecraft.</li>

        <li>Open Source Nature: The open-source status of Eaglercraft's codebase is sometimes cited as a mitigating factor, though this doesn't override copyright concerns.</li>
        <li>Abandoned Software: There's an ongoing debate about the accessibility of older software versions, with some arguing that older Minecraft versions should be freely available.</li>
    </ul>
